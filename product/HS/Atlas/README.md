The data here is the harmonized system being used in the international atlas:
http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/


## Other stuff

- The input files came from doing a database dump on the atlas from the mysql
  command line.
- Atlas HS data comes from BACI http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=1
- It was based on HS92 that they used, I think.
- It doesn’t include services, (98xx and 99xx)
- Highest level is replaced by a custom made classification level (NOT
  Michele’s communities) that merges some related categories together to have a
  more pleasing visual result for treemaps - too many categories results in too
  many colors, which results in colors that are difficult to distinguish.
- Official HS is compiled by the WCOOMD and is here:
