The classification for Colombian Trade data, when looking at export destination
countries.

Jose Ramon says the original is from DANE, and they got them from DIAN. No link
AFAIK :(

This is basically [ISO Alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3), but with a few
custom changes and edits, perhaps from a slightly older version.

	c_acode	c_numcode	c_name	code	name
21	BES	98	Bonaire,San Eustatius y Saba		
55	CUW	200	Curazao		
192	SCG	688	Serbia y Montenegro		
205	SSD	760	Sudan del Sur		
212	SXM	699	San Martin (Parte Holandesa)		
249	ZZZ	999	No Declarados		
250	XCF	XCF	Zonas Francas	

The Bonaire / Cura√ßao / St Maarten thing is known - the Netherland Antilles (ANT) dissolved into 3 countries in 2010 - codes look correct.
Serbia and Montenegro separated, and they should be using the separate codes, but it seems they haven't updated for that.
Zona Franca is the special economic zones.
SSD was missing in my copy of ISO-3 but is official.
